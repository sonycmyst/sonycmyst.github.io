description: You're a creative who understand the value of a strong, unique soundtrack and the power it has to amplify a story from the screen into an immersive, soul-gripping experience. You believe music is not an afterthought or background filler but an essential fuel that drives the story forward. I can't wait to hear about your latest project because you know what I do is not just about making music—it's about inspiring new worlds.

Created through a unique collaboration of artists, land and housing activists.“</p><p class="sqsrte-large" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>When the sudden disappearance of water, their main life-source, threatens to upend a vibrant utopia, Blaze, an intrepid teen, must save their community before it’s too late. </em></p><p class="sqsrte-large" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>MINE</strong> is a part of the <a href="https://risehomestories.com" target="_blank">Rise-Home Stories project</a>, a groundbreaking collaboration that aims to reimagine the past, present and future of our communities by transforming the stories we tell about them. In 2018, our group of multimedia storytellers and housing, land and racial justice advocates came together and began a unique co-creative process. We’ve created a suite of five multimedia narrative projects, including <strong>MINE</strong>, that speak to the power of abundance and collective action in the face of increasingly toxic narratives of scarcity and individualism while planting a long-term vision for a just future. <a href="https://risehomestories.com/mine/about/" target="_blank">Learn more.</a></p><p class="sqsrte-large" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Supported by <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/">The Ford Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.joluproductions.com/">JoLu Productions</a> and <a href="https://www.workingfilms.org/">Working Films</a>.
